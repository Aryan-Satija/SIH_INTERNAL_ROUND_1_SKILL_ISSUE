## Project Description

**DocSecure** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize document management and auction processes for a government college with unparalleled security and transparency. By integrating blockchain technology, Sign Protocol, and Availâ€™s light client P2P network, DocSecure ensures the authenticity, integrity, and secure handling of work orders, documents, and auction bids.

## Key Features

### 1. Secure Document Management
- **Digital Signing:** Documents are digitally signed and stored on the blockchain, guaranteeing authenticity and integrity.
- **Public and Private Keys:** Utilizes public keys for document validation and private keys for signing transactions.
- **Hashing and Storage:** Documents are hashed and securely stored on-chain, while images are managed through the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage network.

### 2. On-Chain Verification
- **Sign Protocol Integration:** Ensures the identity of document issuers and verifies the integrity of documents.
- **Hash Comparison:** During validation, the system regenerates and compares document hashes to confirm authenticity.

### 3. Auction System Integration
- **Robust Auction System:** Facilitates a transparent and secure auction process for procuring services or equipment.
- **Avail P2P Network:** Enhances the performance and security of the auction process with scalable and efficient data availability.

### 4. User Roles and Permissions
- **Creators and Validators:** Different roles with specific permissions to ensure secure and controlled document creation and validation.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Manages access based on user roles to handle work orders and auction details securely.
